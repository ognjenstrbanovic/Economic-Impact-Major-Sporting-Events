Project Requirements:  

- Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset(s).  
- Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.  
- Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis.  
- Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6–8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per ”question” you ask of your data).  
- Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation.  
- (Optional) Use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions.  
- Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” you asked of your data
and a short description of your findings and any relevant plots.  

Presentation Requirements  

You will also be responsible for preparing a formal, 10-minute presentation that covers:  
- Questions you found interesting and what motivated you to answer them  
- Where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions  
- The data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)  
- The analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)  
- Your conclusions, which should include a numerical summary and visualizations of that summary  
- The implications of your findings: what do your findings mean?
