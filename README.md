You can see above the general topic of "Project 1", a project that lasted nearly half of a month and that I considered myself to be a big part of.  
The requirements were as follows:  

> Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset(s).  
> Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process, and illustrating the final data analysis.  
> Use Matplotlib to create at least 2 visualizations per ”question” you ask of your data).  
> Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” you asked of your data
and a short description of your findings and any relevant plots.  

You may see my notebook - and the process of how I met these requirements - here: https://github.com/ognjenstrbanovic/Project-1/blob/master/Ognjen%20%C5%A0trbanovi%C4%87/London%20%26%20SA%20-%20Infrastructure%20%26%20Analysis.ipynb.  

In addition, we were all responsible for "preparing a formal, 10-minute presentation".  
I wanted to highlight my end of the presentation below...
